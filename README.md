# Weather App React

This is an app that provides the weather forecast for a given location for the next 5 days.

# Prerequisites

To run locally the app, you need to have node installed in your machine.

# Run client locally

    npm install
    npm run start

For production you can run following command that will generate a dist folder.

    npm run build

# Run unit tests

Due the lack of time I made just unit tests for the reducers.

    npm run test

#OpenWeatherMap API

Unfortunately the daily forecast is only available for paid costumers, so because of that I used the Yahoo API instead.
You can see that here: https://openweathermap.org/price
